# Render Sleep Issue Fix

## The Problem

Your Aquads backend is hosted on **Render's Starter plan ($7/month)**, which still has a sleep behavior:
- Services go to sleep after **15 minutes of inactivity**
- When sleeping, the first request takes **10-30 seconds** to "cold start"
- This causes slow loading when you wake up and try to access the website on mobile

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Server-Side Keep-Alive (Primary Solution)

**Location**: `server/index.js`

I've added a self-pinging mechanism that runs every 10 minutes in production:

```javascript
// Server pings itself every 10 minutes to prevent sleep
const KEEP_ALIVE_INTERVAL = 10 * 60 * 1000; // 10 minutes
const SERVER_URL = 'https://aquads.onrender.com';

const keepAlive = () => {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    setInterval(async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get(`${SERVER_URL}/api/health`, {
          timeout: 10000
        });
        console.log('Keep-alive ping successful');
      } catch (error) {
        console.log('Keep-alive ping error:', error.message);
      }
    }, KEEP_ALIVE_INTERVAL);
  }
};
```

### 2. Frontend Improvements

**Location**: `src/services/api.js` and `src/App.js`

- **Retry Logic**: Added exponential backoff retry mechanism for failed requests
- **Cold Start Detection**: Detects when server was sleeping (response > 5 seconds)
- **Loading Indicator**: Shows "Server was sleeping, now awake!" message
- **Better Caching**: Improved cached data fallback when server is unavailable

### 3. External Keep-Alive Service (Backup Solution)

**Files**: `keep-alive.js` and `keep-alive-package.json`

A standalone Node.js service that can run on a different platform to ping your server:

```bash
# To use the external keep-alive service:
npm install --package-lock-only --package-lock-only-file=keep-alive-package.json
node keep-alive.js
```

## Deployment Instructions

### Option A: Deploy Current Changes (Recommended)

1. **Deploy to Render**: Push your current changes to your Git repository
2. **Render will automatically redeploy** with the new keep-alive mechanism
3. **Monitor logs**: Check Render logs to see "Keep-alive ping successful" messages every 10 minutes

### Option B: Upgrade Render Plan (Most Effective)

Upgrade to **Render Professional plan ($25/month)**:
- No sleep behavior
- Always-on services
- Better performance
- More resources

### Option C: Use External Keep-Alive Service

Deploy the `keep-alive.js` script on:
- **Vercel** (as a serverless function with cron)
- **Railway** (as a separate service)
- **Your local computer** (running 24/7)
- **GitHub Actions** (with scheduled workflows)

## How to Monitor

### Check if Keep-Alive is Working

1. **Render Logs**: Look for "Keep-alive ping successful" every 10 minutes
2. **Response Times**: Monitor your website - should load quickly even after hours of inactivity
3. **Health Endpoint**: Visit `https://aquads.onrender.com/api/health` directly

### Expected Behavior After Fix

- **Before**: 30-60 second loading time after inactivity
- **After**: 1-3 second loading time consistently

## Alternative Solutions

### 1. Use UptimeRobot (Free)
- Sign up at uptimerobot.com
- Add your health endpoint: `https://aquads.onrender.com/api/health`
- Set check interval to 5 minutes
- Free tier allows 50 monitors

### 2. Use Pingdom or Similar Services
- Most uptime monitoring services can ping your server
- Set interval to 5-10 minutes

### 3. GitHub Actions Cron Job

Create `.github/workflows/keep-alive.yml`:

```yaml
name: Keep Alive
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/10 * * * *'  # Every 10 minutes
jobs:
  keep-alive:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Ping server
        run: curl -f https://aquads.onrender.com/api/health || exit 1
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Server Still Sleeps

1. **Check Render logs** for keep-alive messages
2. **Verify environment**: Make sure `NODE_ENV=production` on Render
3. **Check server URL**: Ensure `https://aquads.onrender.com` is correct
4. **Monitor timing**: Keep-alive should run every 10 minutes

### If Loading is Still Slow

1. **Check network**: Test from different devices/networks
2. **Database connection**: MongoDB might also be sleeping
3. **Consider upgrading**: Professional plan eliminates all sleep issues

## Cost Analysis

| Solution | Cost | Effectiveness | Complexity |
|----------|------|---------------|------------|
| Server Self-Ping | Free | 90% | Low |
| External Keep-Alive | Free-$5/month | 95% | Medium |
| Render Professional | $25/month | 100% | None |
| UptimeRobot | Free | 85% | Low |

## Recommendation

1. **Start with the server self-ping** (already implemented)
2. **Monitor for 2-3 days** to see if loading improves
3. **If still having issues**, set up UptimeRobot as backup
4. **Consider upgrading to Professional** if budget allows

The self-ping solution should solve your morning loading issues. The server will stay awake and respond quickly when you access it on mobile.
