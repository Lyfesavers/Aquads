# ✅ Telegram Daily Engagement System - IMPLEMENTED

## What Was Built

Users earn points daily for being active in your **private Aquads group** (`-1002412665250`):

| Activity | Points | Frequency |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Send any message | **2.5 points** | Once per day |
| React to any post | **2.5 points** | Once per day |
| **Maximum daily** | **5 points** | Total |

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Experience

**Day 1 - 9:00 AM:**
```
User: "Good morning everyone!"
Bot DM: ✅ +2.5 points for daily message!
        💰 Earned today: 2.5 points
```

**Day 1 - 2:00 PM:**
```
User: Reacts with 👍 to someone's post
Bot DM: ✅ +2.5 points for daily reaction!
        💰 Earned today: 5 points (max reached)
```

**Day 1 - 6:00 PM:**
```
User: Sends another message
Bot: (silent - already earned message points today)
```

**Day 2 - 8:00 AM:**
```
User: "GM!"
Bot DM: ✅ +2.5 points for daily message!
        (Fresh day, can earn again!)
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Push Code
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Telegram daily engagement points system"
git push origin master
```

### 2. Wait for Render Deploy
- Takes ~3-5 minutes
- Watch deployment logs

### 3. Update Webhook (CRITICAL!)

You need to add `message_reaction` to allowed updates.

**Run this command** (replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN`):

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://aquads.onrender.com/api/twitter-raids/telegram-webhook",
    "allowed_updates": ["message", "callback_query", "message_reaction"]
  }'
```

**Or via PowerShell:**
```powershell
$botToken = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
$body = @{
  url = "https://aquads.onrender.com/api/twitter-raids/telegram-webhook"
  allowed_updates = @("message", "callback_query", "message_reaction")
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST `
  -Uri "https://api.telegram.org/bot$botToken/setWebhook" `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body $body
```

### 4. Verify Webhook

```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo").Content
```

Look for:
```json
"allowed_updates": ["message", "callback_query", "message_reaction"]
```

The `message_reaction` part is crucial!

### 5. Test

1. Link account if not already: `/link username` with `@aquadsbumpbot`
2. Send message in private group
3. Should get DM with +2.5 points
4. React to any message with 👍
5. Should get DM with +2.5 more points
6. Try again - should NOT get more points (already earned today)

## 🛡️ Anti-Spam Features

✅ **Daily Cap**: Can only earn once per activity per day
✅ **Separate Tracking**: Message ≠ Reaction (both can be earned)
✅ **Midnight Reset**: UTC timezone
✅ **Bot Messages Ignored**: Bots don't earn points
✅ **Race Condition Safe**: Handles concurrent requests
✅ **Must Be Linked**: Only linked Telegram accounts earn points

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### Per User
- Max: 5 points per day
- Consistent user: 35 points per week
- Monthly top engager: ~150 points

### Group-Wide (100 members)
- 30% daily participation = 30 users
- Average: ~75-100 points distributed per day
- Active community: 500-700 points per week

---

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Check Today's Stats

```javascript
// MongoDB
use aquads
const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]

// Today's active users
db.telegramdailyengagements.countDocuments({ date: today })

// Users who got both bonuses
db.telegramdailyengagements.countDocuments({
  date: today,
  hasMessagedToday: true,
  hasReactedToday: true
})

// Total points distributed today
db.telegramdailyengagements.aggregate([
  { $match: { date: today } },
  { $group: { 
      _id: null, 
      total: { $sum: { $add: ["$messagePoints", "$reactionPoints"] } }
  }}
])
```

### Server Logs

Watch for:
- ✅ `Awarded 2.5 points to USERNAME for daily message`
- ✅ `Awarded 2.5 points to USERNAME for daily reaction`
- ℹ️ `User already earned message/reaction points today` (normal)

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Users not getting points

**Check:**
1. User linked? (`db.users.findOne({ telegramId: "XXX" })`)
2. Already earned today? (check database for today's record)
3. In correct group? (Group ID: `-1002412665250`)
4. Webhook configured? (check `allowed_updates`)

**Fix:**
- Link account: `/link username` with bot
- Wait until next day if already earned
- Verify webhook has `message_reaction` enabled

### Issue: Webhook not receiving reactions

**Most common**: Webhook not updated with `message_reaction`

**Fix**: Run the webhook update command from step 3 above

---

## 💡 Why This Works Better Than Channel Tracking

✅ **Groups support all Bot API features** (channels don't)
✅ **Full tracking capability** (messages, reactions, etc.)
✅ **Natural engagement** (people actually chat)
✅ **Anti-spam built-in** (daily limits prevent gaming)
✅ **Rewards consistency** (not one-time reactions)
