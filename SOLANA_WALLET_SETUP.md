# Solana Wallet Support for LiFi Widget

## What We Added

### 1. Installed Reown AppKit Packages
```bash
npm install @reown/appkit @reown/appkit-adapter-solana
```

### 2. Created Simple Solana Wallet Provider
- File: `src/providers/SolanaWalletProvider.js`
- Includes only Phantom and Solflare wallets (most popular)
- Minimal setup that works with LiFi widget

### 3. Updated LiFi Providers
- File: `src/providers/LiFiProviders.js`
- Wrapped existing setup with SolanaWalletProvider
- No changes to existing QueryClient configuration

### 4. Enhanced WalletConnect Metadata
- File: `src/components/AquaSwap.js`
- Added proper metadata to WalletConnect configuration
- This helps with wallet recognition and mobile connections

## What This Enables

1. **Desktop Solana Wallets**: Phantom, Solflare browser extensions
2. **Mobile Solana Wallets**: WalletConnect support for mobile wallets
3. **Cross-Chain Support**: Works alongside existing EVM wallet support

## Testing

1. Make sure your `.env` file has a valid WalletConnect project ID:
   ```
   REACT_APP_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_from_reown_cloud
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Navigate to the AquaSwap page and try connecting Solana wallets

## Troubleshooting

If Solana wallets don't appear:
1. Check that you have Phantom or Solflare installed
2. Verify your WalletConnect project ID is correct
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Try refreshing the page

## No Breaking Changes

- All existing functionality remains intact
- EVM wallets continue to work as before
- Only added Solana wallet support on top of existing setup
