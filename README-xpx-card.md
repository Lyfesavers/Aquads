# XPX Card Image Instructions

The XPX card button has been added to your user dashboard below the affiliate program section. To make it work properly, you need to replace the placeholder image with the actual XPX card image you shared.

## Steps to Replace the Image

1. Take the XPX card image you shared (purple background with the gold/orange card)
2. Save it as `xpx-card.png`
3. Copy it to the `public` folder in your project, replacing the existing placeholder file

This will ensure the button displays the correct image when users view the dashboard.
