        question: "What is the key goal of system integration testing within an architecture lifecycle?",
        options: [
          "Verify that independently developed components work together and meet integration requirements",
          "Focus only on unit tests for each component in isolation to guarantee correctness",
          "Measure runtime performance of the full system under production load exclusively",
          "Satisfy compliance checklists without exercising real integration scenarios"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation: "Integration tests validate interactions and interfaces among components, not just isolated units."

        question: "Which leadership approach best improves technical team performance sustainably?",
        options: [
          "Cultivate technical excellence, cross-team collaboration, and continuous learning practices",
          "Drive output solely through strict deadlines and individual productivity targets",
          "Reduce investment in training to force on-the-job learning under pressure",
          "Rely only on performance bonuses to elicit higher engineering results"

        question: "Why is thoughtful API design critical in modern system architecture?",
        options: [
          "APIs expose stable contracts for interoperability, enabling maintainability and developer efficiency",
          "APIs primarily serve to hide internal systems and should be limited in surface area",
          "APIs exist mostly for documentation purposes rather than runtime integration goals",
          "APIs should always be as feature-rich as possible to avoid future changes"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation: "Well-designed APIs define stable integration points that enable independent evolution and reuse."

        question: "How should technology selection be performed for long-lived architectural initiatives?",
        options: [
          "Evaluate fit against requirements, team capability, ecosystem maturity, and long-term support",
          "Always adopt the newest technology to demonstrate technical leadership and innovation",
          "Select tools based solely on current team familiarity to minimize short-term ramp-up",
          "Outsource selection decisions to vendors who can guarantee long-term pricing"

        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation: "Selection requires balancing requirements, team skills, and ecosystem sustainability over time."
